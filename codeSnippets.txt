		<h2 id="curricula">Curriculum</h2>
				<p>Our curriculum aligns with the Kentucky Early Learning Standards and allows children the opportunity to explore, observe, socialize with other children, problem solve, and experiment in a structured yet choice-based environment. The learning environment encourages children to ask questions, make conclusions, and develop independence. The different types of activities will stimulate a child's cognitive, social, emotional, and physical growth.</p>
