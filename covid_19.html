          &#9830; For pick up and drop off, please call the main number at YLA.  A staff member will come out to assist in taking the children into or out of the center to eliminate unnecessary traffic to classrooms and exposure of children.  Parents and custodial adults are requested to wear cloth face coverings or masks during pick-up and drop-off. Parents and custodial adults will log in online when they drop off or pick up their child.
          <br/>

        <p>
          &#9830; YLA will ensure the cleaning and sanitation of frequently touched surfaces with appropriate disinfectants, in accordance with appropriate Kentucky child care standards. Frequently touched surfaces that are regularly disinfected include door knobs and handles.  Cleaning will not include procedures that could re-aerosolize infectious particles. This includes avoiding practices such as dry sweeping or use of high-pressure streams of air, water, or cleaning chemicals. The cleaning and sanitizing plan will be posted. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; Toys that cannot be cleaned and sanitized such as machine washable cloth toys will not be used. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; Toys that children have placed in their mouths or that are otherwise contaminated by bodily secretions will be set aside in a separate container marked for soiled toys until they are cleaned by hand by a person wearing gloves. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; Children’s books, like other paper-based materials, are not considered a high risk for transmission and do not need additional cleaning or disinfection procedures.  Plastic infant and toddler books will be cleaned and sanitized as the material allows. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; Parents or legal guardians are asked to bring a bin to store each child’s bedding (sheets, pillows, blankets, sleeping bags) separately.  The bin containing bedding will be sent home weekly to be cleaned.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; Parents or legal guardians are asked to bring a bin to store each child’s toys.  The toys will be washed and sanitized daily by the teachers.  Toys will not be shared between children.

Staff members and children will wash their hands upon arrival for the day, after breaks, upon returning from outside, after toileting or assisting a child with toileting, after each diaper change or pull-up change, after contact with bodily fluids or cleaning up spills or objects contaminated with bodily fluids, after cleaning or sanitizing or using any chemical products, before eating, serving or preparing food or bottles or feeding a child, before and after completing a medical procedure or administering medication, when visibly soiled (must use soap and water), and prior to departure. Staff will assist children with hand hygiene. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          &#9830; YLA will encourage staff members/employees and children to limit touching their mouth, nose, and face.
